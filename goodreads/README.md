## Missing Values

The dataset did show some missing values across notable fields:

- `isbn`: 700 missing entries

## Correlation Matrix Insights

The correlation between various attributes within the dataset provided fascinating insights:

- **Ratings Correlation**:
    - `ratings_count` had the highest correlation with `work_ratings_count` at 0.995, indicating that higher counts of individual ratings correlate with overall work ratings.
    - The correlations between ratings also demonstrated that high scores in one category are likely mirrored in others (e.g., ratings 4 and 5).

- **Books Count Insight**:
    - Interestingly, `books_count` showcases a negative correlation with `average_rating` (-0.06988), suggesting that books with a higher number of editions may not necessarily receive higher average ratings.
